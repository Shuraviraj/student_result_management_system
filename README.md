## How to Run this application

 - Install Java and Netbeans via (for windows only) -> [Install NetBeans 16 with Java 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45ng2smz_w0)
	 - open **terminal/ powershell and type following command** to check the requirement met to run this application
	 - `java -version`
 - Install Postgresql via (for windows only) -> [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHx0ovvxPs)
 - Install git via -> [Install and Configure Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdzKzlp66sQ)
 - Clone this repository using below code
	 - `git clone https://github.com/Shuraviraj/student_result_management_system.git`
 - you might face issue with rs2xml and postgresqJarfile these file are already there in this repo just resolve it via locating this into your local machine
 - create database with following name into postgresql using PGAdmin
	 - `student_result_management_system`
	 - Database credential :-
		 - username : postgres
		 - password : postgres
	 - Create three table with following detail make sure all these are case sensitive
		 - student : `CREATE TABLE public.student (
	rollno int4 NOT NULL,
	course varchar(100) NULL,
	branch varchar(100) NULL,
	fullname varchar(100) NULL,
	gender varchar(100) NULL,
	fathername varchar(100) NULL,
	CONSTRAINT student_pkey PRIMARY KEY (rollno)
);`
		 - result : `CREATE TABLE public."result" (
	rollno int4 NOT NULL,
	physics varchar(10) NULL,
	maths varchar(10) NULL,
	em varchar(10) NULL,
	dbms varchar(10) NULL,
	os varchar(10) NULL,
	CONSTRAINT result_pkey PRIMARY KEY (rollno)
);`
		 - admin : `CREATE TABLE public."admin" (
	username varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	pass varchar(10) NULL,
	CONSTRAINT admin_pkey PRIMARY KEY (username)
);`
 - For creating admin you will need a superadmin access so below is the super admin credential
	 - username : admin
	 - password : 1234
	 - (please change it after cloning the repo you can fine it in **AdminHome.java** -> **line 191 & 193**)
 - To run application go to AdminIndex right click on it and click on run ðŸ˜„

## Future Scope

+ Fetching results based on the course.
+ Adding student branch according to the course.
+ Updating student marks.
